title: "Spatial Inequality in Central and Eastern Europe"
subtitle: "Geospatial analysis of regional disparities"
---

## Overview

This visualization presents a geospatial analysis of regional inequalities across Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The map reveals spatial patterns of economic development, highlighting urban-rural divides and cross-border disparities.

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Eurostat Regional Statistics** - NUTS-2/NUTS-3 level data
- **GISCO (Geographic Information System of the Commission)** - Spatial boundaries
- **National statistical offices** - Supplementary regional data

### Technical Approach

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: show

# Key packages used
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)           # Simple features for spatial data
library(giscoR)       # Eurostat geographic data
library(ggplot2)

# Spatial data handling
# cee_regions <- gisco_get_nuts(
#   year = "2021",
#   resolution = "10",
#   nuts_level = "2"
# )

# Choropleth mapping
# Regional inequality indices
# Cross-border pattern analysis
```

### Key Features
- **High-resolution regional mapping** at NUTS-2/NUTS-3 level
- **Comparative cross-country analysis** within CEE
- **Urban-rural gradient visualization**

## Spatial Patterns Revealed

The analysis highlights several key patterns:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Capital city effect** | Concentration of prosperity around capitals |
| **East-West gradient** | Persistent disparities within countries |
| **Border effects** | Economic differences at national boundaries |
| **Industrial legacy** | Impact of historical industrial centers |

## Geospatial Skills Demonstrated

| Skill | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Spatial data handling | sf package for geometries |
| Choropleth mapping | ggplot2 + geom_sf |
| Data integration | Joining statistics to boundaries |
| Cartographic design | Color scales, projections |
