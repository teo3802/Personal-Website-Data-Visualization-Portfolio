subtitle: "Educational attainment transitions between generations in Austria"
---

## Overview

This visualization explores intergenerational educational mobility in Austria, examining how educational attainment levels transmit across generations. The analysis reveals patterns of upward mobility, persistence, and barriers in educational achievement.

:::

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- **OECD Education at a Glance** - International education statistics
- **Statistik Austria** - National education surveys
- **EU-LFS (Labour Force Survey)** - Educational background data

### Technical Approach

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: show

# Key packages used
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggalluvial)  # for Sankey/alluvial diagrams

# Transition matrix calculation
# Parent education → Child education flows
# Mobility index computation

# Visualization approaches:
# - Alluvial/Sankey diagrams for flows
# - Heatmaps for transition probabilities
# - Slope charts for generational comparison
```

### Key Features
- **Flow visualization** showing educational transitions
- **Quantified mobility** metrics
- **Generational comparison** framework

## Interpretation

The visualization reveals:

- **Persistence patterns** - Where educational attainment tends to be inherited
- **Upward mobility corridors** - Paths of educational advancement
- **Structural barriers** - Bottlenecks in educational progression

## Skills Demonstrated
