## Overview

This interactive flexdashboard provides a comparative analysis of educational attainment levels between native-born and foreign-born populations across OECD member countries (plus Bulgaria and Romania). The dashboard enables exploration of education-migration intersections through interactive visualizations.

## Dashboard Features

### 📊 Stacked Bar Chart

- Compare native-born vs. foreign-born populations
- Educational levels: Below upper secondary, Upper secondary, Tertiary
- Country-specific analysis with aggregation over selected years

### 🌍 Interactive World Map

- Choropleth visualization of OECD + EU countries
- Filter by birth place (native/foreign-born)
- Filter by education level
- Natural Earth projection for global context

### ⚙️ Interactive Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Country | Select country for bar chart comparison |
| Birth place | Native-born or Foreign-born filter for map |
| Education level | Filter map by educational attainment |
| Year range | Slider for temporal aggregation |

## Technical Implementation

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: show

# Core libraries
library(flexdashboard)
library(shiny)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(arrow)

# Data loaded from Parquet format (efficient columnar storage)
educ <- arrow::read_parquet("OECD_EducAtt.parquet")

# Interactive bar chart with plotly
plot_ly(
  data  = df_top,
  x     = ~BirthPlace,
  y     = ~Value,
  color = ~EducLevel,
  type  = "bar"
) %>%
  layout(barmode = "stack")

# Interactive choropleth map
plot_ly(
  df_map,
  type = "choropleth",
  locations = ~CountryCode,
  z = ~Value,
  locationmode = "ISO-3"
) %>%
  layout(
    geo = list(
      projection = list(type = "natural earth")
    )
  )
```

## Data Sources

## Key Insights Enabled

The dashboard facilitates analysis of:

1. **Integration outcomes** - How do foreign-born populations compare in educational attainment?
2. **Country differences** - Which countries show largest gaps between native and foreign-born?
3. **Temporal trends** - How have patterns changed over time?
4. **Education levels** - At which levels are gaps most pronounced?

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: ShinyApps.io

```r
# Flexdashboard with runtime: shiny requires Shiny server
rsconnect::deployApp("NIKOLOV_GlobalMacroMonitor_OECD.Rmd")
```

### Option 2: Posit Connect / Shiny Server

For organizational deployment with enhanced features.

### Option 3: Run Locally

```r
rmarkdown::run("NIKOLOV_GlobalMacroMonitor_OECD.Rmd")
```
